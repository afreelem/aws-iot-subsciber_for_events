# aws-iot-subsciber_for_events

For Capturing the Events in AWS-IOT you need defined a rule which sends all the different events to a particular topic and from that topic we can subscribe and store them inside a db

This is used for capturing the evets ( i.e connect,disconnect,subscribe and unsubscribe) and Insert them in Relational Database(Mysql)
